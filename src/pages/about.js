    <h1>About me </h1>
    <div>
      <p>Hi, My name is Matthew Reyes. I was born here in the Bay Area, but for High School, I lived in the Philippines and went to International School Manila. Growing up I use to tear apart all the broken electronics in the house, and some electronics that were not to my parent's dismay - That changed in High School after I took an Intro to Computer Science course, I built my first computer and programmed algorithms into my ti-83.
      </p>
      <p>Programming and tinkering continued in college but my focus shifted to data, and I got a B.A. in Business Managment Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fast forward a couple of years, many online programming tutorials; between developer events I got tired of copying and pasting my driver summaries from Lyft's Drivers Portal into Excel. I hacked together Python, Selenium WebDriver, and Beautiful Soup and I automated that process.
      </p>
      <p>Watching that script run and download every ride after facing hurdle after hurdle - I knew I would enjoy this kind of work. Looking towards the future with Robotics, A.I., Machine Learning and just how Apps can have a positive impact on hundreds of thousands if not billions of individuals are just cool and is something I want to be a part of.
