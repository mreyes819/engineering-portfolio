    <h1>About me </h1>
    <div>
    <p>I was born here in the Bay Area but lived abroad. Growing up I use to tear apart all the broken electronics in the house, and some electronics that were not to my parent's dismay. That changed in High School after I took an Intro to Computer Science course, I built my first computer and programmed algorithms into my ti-83.
    </p>
    <p>Programming and tinkering continued in college but my focus shifted to data, and I got a degree in Economics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Fast forward a couple of years, many online programming tutorials, I was between event jobs driving for Lyft, and I got tired of copying and pasting my driver summaries into excel. I decided to automate that process, using python I wrote a script with selenium and beautiful soup.
    </p>

    <p>Watching that script run and download every ride entry after many months of tinkering with the intricacies of Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup, concurring challenge after challenge - I knew I would enjoy this kind of work. Below is a list of technologies I have experienced.
